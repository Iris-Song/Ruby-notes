# Class
## Design Ideas
+ writing short, focused methods, each with a name that tells the reader exactly what it does.
+ compress specifications
   + a good example:
   ```
    class TextCompressor
        attr_reader :unique, :index

        def initialize( text )
            @unique = []
            @index = []
            add_text( text )
        end

        def add_text( text )
            words = text.split
            words.each { |word| add_word( word ) }
        end

        def add_word( word )
            i = unique_index_of( word ) || add_unique_word( word )
            @index << i
        end

        def unique_index_of( word )
            @unique.index(word)
        end

        def add_unique_word( word )
            @unique << word
            unique.size - 1
        end
    end
   ```
+ compose method for humans
+ every method should have exactly one way out.
   + a good example:
  ```
  class Document
    # Most of class omitted

    def prose_rating
        return :really_pretentious if really_pretentious?
        return :somewhat_pretentious if somewhat_pretentious?
        return :really_informal if really_informal?
        return :somewhat_informal if somewhat_informal?
        return :about_right
    end

    def really_pretentious?
        pretentious_density > 0.3 && informal_density < 0.2
    end

    def somewhat_pretentious?
        pretentious_density > 0.3 && informal_density >= 0.2
    end

    def really_informal?
        pretentious_density < 0.1 && informal_density > 0.3
    end

    def somewhat_informal?
        pretentious_density < 0.1 && informal_density <= 0.3
    end

    def pretentious_density
        # somehow compute density of pretentious word
    end

    def informal_density
        # somehow compute density of informal word
    end
  end
  ```

### [`ActiveRecord::Base`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html)
+ `base.rb`

## singleton
allow produce objects donot follow the rules laid down by its class.

`singleton method` is a method that is defined for exactly one object instance.
```
hand_built_stub_printer = Object.new

def hand_built_stub_printer.available?
    true
end

def hand_built_stub_printer.render?
    nil
end
```

Singleton methods are in all respects ordinary methods: They can accept arguments, return values, and do anything else that a regular method can do. The only difference is that singleton methods are stuck to a single object instance.

Singleton methods override any regular, class-defined methods.
```
uncooperative = "Don't ask my class"

def uncooperative.class
    "I am not telling"
end

puts uncooperative.class

>>I am not telling
```

### How to  implement singleton?
the singleton class—sits between every object and its regular class.

## Class Instance

Class variables start with two @’s instead of one and are associated with a class instead of an ordinary instance.

### Find Varaiable
#### assign a Varaiable
@@default_paper_size = :a4, Ruby needs to figure out which class will provide the home for the @@default_ paper_size variable. 

Ruby starts by looking at the current class.

If the class variable is not defined in the current class, Ruby will go looking up the inheritance tree for it.

If Ruby runs out of classes without finding @@default_paper_size, then it will create a new class variable in the current class.

#### Looking up the value
Looking up the value of a class variable works pretty much the same way. Ruby starts with the current class and looks up the inheritance tree; it either finds the variable or runs out of classes and throws a `NameError` exception
