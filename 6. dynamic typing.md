# Dynamic Typing
+ Ruby does not judge an object by its class hierarchy
+ In Ruby, any two classes that `can` work together will `work` together.
+ Don't create more infrastructure than upi really need.
+ Ruby classes don't need to be related by inheritance to share a common interface; they only need to support the same method.
+ Don't obscure your code with pointless checks to see whether `this` really is an instance of `that`.
