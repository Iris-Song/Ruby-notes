# Block
## define
a block like:
```
do_something do
    puts "Hello"
end
```
or :
```
do_something {puts "Hello"}
```
Inside the method you can detect whether your caller has actually passed in a block with the `block_given?`method and fire off the block (if there is one) with `yield`
```
def do_something_with_an_arg
  yield("Hello World") if block_given?
end

do_something_with_an_arg do |message|
  puts "The message is #{message}"
end

# output:
# The message is Hello World
```
## interator
An iterator method calls its block once for each element in some collection, passing the element into the block as a parameter. 
```
class Document
    #stuff omitted
    def each_word
        words.each { |word| yield( word ) }
    end
end
```
