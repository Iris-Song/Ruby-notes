# Object

In Ruby, `string`, `symbol`, `regexp`, `true`, `false`, `class` are all objects
```
puts nil.class
puts nil.nil?
>>NilClass
>>true
```

+ override `object`
```
class Document
    # Mostly omitted

    def to_s
      "Document: #{title} by #{author}
    end
end
```
+ reflection-oriented methods  
`instance_variables`
```
pp doc.instance_variables
>>[:@title, :@author, :content]
```

## Public, Private, Protected
### Private
+ adding private before method defination
```
class Document
    # Most of the class omitted
    private #Methods are private starting here
    def word_count
        return words.size
    end
end
```
+ making private after the fact
```
class Document
    # Most of the class omitted
    def word_count
        return words.size
    end

    private :word_count
end
```
+ cannot all a private method with an explicit object reference. Private methods can only be called from inside the class that defined them.
+ private methods are callable from subclasses.

### Protected
Any instance of a class can call a protected method on any other instance of the class, including instances of subclasses.
```
class RomanceNovel < Document
    def number_of_steamy_words
        word_count / 4
    end
end
```
