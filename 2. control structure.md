# Control Structure
### some examples
```
until document.printed?
  document.print_next_page
end


@title = new_title unless @read_only


author = case title
         when 'War And Peace' then 'Tolstoy'
         when 'Remeo And Juliet' then 'Shakespeare'
         else "Don't know"
         end

author = case title
         when /War And .*/ then 'Tolstoy'
         when /Remeo And .*/ then 'Shakespeare'
         end

until (next_object = get_next_object).nil?
   # Do something with the object
end

until (next_object = get_next_object) == nil
   # Do something with the object
end
```

#### use the first control structure in below list
```
unless == if not
until == while not

# but don't use ||= to initialize things to booleans
@name ||= ''
@name = '' unless @name
```
#### use each, not for
becasue Ruby actually defines *for* loop in terms of *each* method.
```
fonts.each do |font|
   put font
end

for font in fonts
   put font
end

```

#### BOOL
In Ruby, only *false* and *nil* are treated as false.
The sentences will print something.
```
puts 'Sorry, but 0 is true!' if 0

puts 'Sorry, but "false" is not false!' if 'false'
```

#### defined?
* The idea behind 'defined?' will tell whether some Ruby expression is defined or not
* *defined?* returns either *a string that descibles the thing passed in* or *nil*
```
doc = Document.new( 'a','b','c' )
# flag will return "local variable"
flag = defined?( doc )
```
