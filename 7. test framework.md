# Test Framework

## `Test::Unit`
+ comes packaged with Ruby itself
+ XUnit family of testing frameworks
+ In `Test::Unit`, each test is packaged in a method whose name needs to begin with `test_`
+ [`assertions`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.1.0/Test/Unit/Assertions.html)
```
class DocumentTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
    def setup
        @text = 'A bunch of words'
        @doc = Document.new('test', 'nobody', @text)
    end

    def test_document_holds_onto_contents
        assert_equal @text, @doc.content, 'Contents are still there'
    end

    def test_that_doc_can_return_words_in_array
        assert @doc.words.include?('A')
        assert @doc.words.include?('bunch')
        assert @doc.words.include?('of')
        assert @doc.words.include?('words')
    end

    def test_that_word_count_is_correct
        assert_equal 4, @doc.word_count, 'Word count is correct'
    end
end
```

## RSepc
+ RSpec tries to weave a sort of pseudo-English out of Ruby. The code isn't a test, it's a description.
+ `before:each`, `before:all`, `after:each`, `after:all`
```
require 'document.rb'
require 'rspec'
describe Document do
    before :each do
        @text = 'A bunch of words'
        @doc = Document.new('test', 'nobody', @text)
    end

    it 'should hold on to the contens' do
        @doc.content.should == @text
    end

    it 'should know which words it has' do
        @doc.words.should include('A')
        @doc.words.should include('bunch')
        @doc.words.should include('of')
        @doc.words.should include('words')
    end

    it 'should know how many words it contains' do
        @doc.word_count.should == 4
    end
end
```
### Stubs
+ `stub` : an object that implements the same interface as one of the supporting cast members, but returns canned answers when its methods are called.
+ To use the `stub `method, you pass in a hash of method names (as symbols) and the corresponding values that you want those methods to return.
```
describe PrintableDocument do
    before :each do
        @text = 'A bunch of words'
        @doc = Document.new('test', 'nobody', @text)
    end

    it 'should know how to print itself' do
        stub_printer = stub :available? => true, :render => nil
        @doc.print(stub_printer).should == 'Done'
    end

    it 'should return the proper string if printer is offline' do
        @doc.print(stub_printer).should == 'Printer unavailable'
    end
end
```
+ `stub!`: let you stub out individual methods on any regular object you might have lying around.
```
describe tmpclass do
    #...
    it 'should do sth' do
        apparently_long_string = 'actually short'
        apparently_long_string.stub!(:length).and_return(1000000)
    end
end
```

### mock
+ `mock`: a stub with an attitude
+ Along with knowing what canned responses to return, a mock also knows which methods should be called and with what areguments
```
describe tmpclass do
    #...
    it 'should know how to print itself' do
        mock_printer = mock('Printer')
        mock_printer.should_receive(:available?).and_return(true)
        mock_printer.should_receive(:render).exactly(3).times
        @doc.print(mock_printer).should == 'Done'
    end
end
```

### Minitest
+ can do RSpec style examples but don't need to install RSpec gem.
+ rewrite of Test::Unit

## About Autometed Tests
+ quick
+ slilent: work or not work?
+ avoid having one test rely on the output of a previous test. use RSpec `before(:any)` in preference to `before(:all)`
