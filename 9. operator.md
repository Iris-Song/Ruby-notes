# Operator
+ your hand-crafted *Float* would be indistinguishable from the *Float* class that comes with Ruby.
+ Ruby translates every expression involving programmer-definable operators into a equivalent expression where the operators are replaced with method calls.
+ `<<`
    + left shift operator
    + add another one
       ```
       names = []
       names << 'Rob'
       names << 'Tom
       ```
+ can override `!`, cannot override `not`
+ cannot override: `not`, `and`, `or`, `||`, `&&`. They are built in Ruby, their behavior is fixed.
+ plain old `-` defines binary operator, while `-@` defines the unary one.
