# Module
A Ruby module is the container part of a class without the factory. 

You can’t instantiate a module, but you can put things inside of a module.

Modules can hold methods, constants, classes, and even other modules.
### hold class
```
module Rendering
  class Font
    attr_accessor :name, :weight, :size
    def initialize( name, weight=:normal, size=10 )
      @name = name
      @weight = weight
      @size = size
end
    # Rest of the class omitted...
  end
  class PaperSize
    attr_accessor :name, :width, :height
    def initialize( name='US Let', width=8.5, height=11.0 )
      @name = name
      @width = width
      @height = height
end
    # Rest of the class omitted...
  end
  DEFAULT_FONT = Font.new( 'default' )
  DEFAULT_PAPER_SIZE = PaperSize.new
end

# To get at that font class above you just say 
Rendering::Font.
```
### hold module
modules can be nested
```
module WordProcessor
  module Rendering
    class Font
      # Guts of class omitted...
end
    # and so on...
  end
end
```
### hold methods
```
module WordProcessor
  def self.points_to_inches( points )
    points / 72.0
end
  def self.inches_to_points( inches )
    inches * 72.0
end
  # Rest of the module omitted
end

an_inch_full_of_points = WordProcessor.inches_to_points( 1.0 )
```
## Treat Modules Like the Objects That They Are

## Use Modules as Mixins
To use `number_of_cliches` among otherwise unrelated classes is by creating a mixin module.
```
module WritingQuality

  CLICHES = [ /play fast and loose/,
              /make no mistake/,
              /does the trick/,
              /off and running/,
              /my way or the highway/ ]

  def number_of_cliches
    CLICHES.inject(0) do |count, phrase|
      count += 1 if phrase =~ content
      count 
    end
  end 
end
```

```
class Document
  include WritingQuality

  # Lots of stuff omitted...
end

class ElectronicBook < ElectronicText
  include WritingQuality

  # Lots of stuff omitted...
end
```
The Ruby jargon is that by including a module in a class you have `mixed it in` to the class. We say that the module itself, WritingQuality in this case, is a `mixin module`. 

### Extending a Module
Sometimes it’s the class itself—as opposed to the instances of the class—that needs help from a module. 
```
module Finders
  def find_by_name( name )
    # Find a document by name...
  end

  def find_by_id( doc_id )
    # Find a document by id
  end 
end

class Document
  # Most of the class omitted...
  class << self
    include Finders
  end 
end 

war_and_peace = Document.find_by_name( 'War And Peace' )
```
Including modules into the singleton class is a common enough task that Ruby has a special shortcut for it in the form of `extend`:
```
class Document
  extend Finders
  # Most of the class omitted...
end
```
When you mix a module into a class, Ruby rewires the class hierarchy a bit, inserting the module as a sort of pseudo superclass of the class. 

![](./img/A%20module%20becomes%20a%20pseudo%20superclass%20to%20the%20class%20that%20includes%20it..jpeg)

No matter how many modules a class includes, instances of the class will still claim to be, well, instances of the class. So, if `my_tome` is an instance of `ElectronicBook`, then `my_tome.class` will return `ElectronicBook` no matter how many modules the ElectronicBook class includes. 

You can discover whether the class of an instance includes a given module with the `kind_of?` method. So if Document includes the `WritingQuality` module, then `my_tome.kind_of?(WritingQuality)` will return true. 

`Document.ancestors` might return the following array:
    `[Document, WritingQuality, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]`
