# Gem
Ruby gems, the Ruby solution to packaging up your masterpiece so that it not only goes out the door, but also arrives on your userâ€™s system with all the fragile bits intact.

### Install
```
gem install <package_name>
```
Unix, Linux, OS X
```
sudo gem install <package_name>
```

### Versions
see what versions are available for any given gem with the gem list command
```
gem list -a --remote <package_name>
```
When you install a gem, you will get the latest version unless you ask for something earlier. Thus, if for some reason you needed the very first version:
```
gem install --version <version> <package_name>
```
If you do have more than one version of a gem installed, the default when you ask for the gem in your code is the latest version. If your code depends on a specific gem version, you can ask for it with the gem method:
```
gem 'ruby-mp3info', '=0.5'
require 'mp3info'
```
The version number argument on the gem method even supports more general expressions like `'>0.4'` or `'<=0.5'`
